Sub::Deprecated - Warn when deprecated subroutines are used

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Add the C<:Deprecated> attribute to a subroutine to automatically produce a warning
when used.

    sub old_method : Deprecated(v1.4) {
        ...
    }

    sub older_method : Deprecated(v1.4, 'Use new_method instead.') {
        ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a C<:Deprecated> attribute for subroutines that can be used to
decorate deprecated subroutines.  The decorator produces a warning using the
supplied version string and optional message.
